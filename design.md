#In large-scale applications, I use a layered approach to state management depending on the nature of the data:

1. Local UI State

- I keep transient UI state local to the component using useState or useReducer.

2. Shared App State

- For global state or shared data (like user info, auth tokens, or theme), I use React Context with a combination of useReducer for structured updates.
- However, for more complex shared state, I prefer Redux Toolkit or Zustand because:
  1. Redux has middleware like Redux Thunk.
  2. Zustand is simpler and very performant for non-boilerplate use cases.

#I follow these strategies depending on what I'm optimizing:

1. Avoid unnecessary re-renders

- Use React.memo on presentational components to avoid re-renders unless props change.
- Use useCallback to memoize functions passed to child components.
- Use useMemo for expensive calculations or derived values, especially in filtered or sorted lists.

2. Optimize useEffect

- Ensure useEffect dependencies are minimal and accurate to avoid infinite loops or unnecessary fetches.
- Clean up effects properly (example: cancel debounce, remove event listeners).

3. Example from my project (User Directory):

- I used useMemo to filter users base on the debounced search term, and useCallback for search input handler to avoid re-renders in child components.
- Lazy-loaded large components like UserList and UserGrid using React.lazy + Suspense.

#Accessibility is a must-have in all components I build. My approach includes:

1. Semantic HTML & ARIA

- I use proper semantic elements (<main>, <button>, <header>, <section>) over generic <div>s.
- Add ARIA attributes like aria-live, aria-label, or role when needed.

2. Keyboard Navigation

- Ensure all interactive elements are focusable, and support full keyboard interactions.
- Use IconButton and button elements rather than clickable divs.

3. Color Contrast and Focus

- Ensure color contrast in all webapp elements.
- Provide visible focus outlines and use MUI’s theming to customize it when needed.

4. Example: User Directory

- I’ve wrapped loading spinners in <Box aria-live="polite"> for screen readers.
- IconButton toggles view modes and includes an accessible aria-label.
- Results are grouped in <List> or <Grid>, and I use MUI components which come with built-in accessibility support.
